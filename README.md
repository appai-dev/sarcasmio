# Sarcasmio

As artificial intelligence has continued to revolutionize the way we interact with technology, we ask the important sarcastic questions like why? And WTF is OpenAI API? Are we all going to be put out of a job soon? In order to better understand its capabilities, I decided to explore how sarcastic the OpenAI API is. With the goal of the project to see just how easy and effective is to build a quick app to see how sarcastic it could get.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

cd Sarcasmio

3. Install the dependencies:

npm install

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key, which you can obtain from the [OpenAI Developer Dashboard](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

In addition to the OpenAI API key, you will need to set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary credentials. Please follow the instructions in the Firebase documentation to set up a project and obtain the required configuration values.
