# Sarcasmio

Artificial intelligence has continued to revolutionize the way we interact with technology, with the OpenAI API being one of the most powerful AI tools available today. In order to better understand its capabilities, our team decided to take a unique approach: we created a fun, engaging Node.js app called Sarcasmio. The goal of this project was to see just how easy and effective it was to work with the OpenAI API by leveraging its potential for humor and wit.
